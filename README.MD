## About

This repository focuses on Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD). CI/CD is a software development approach designed to enhance the speed, efficiency, and reliability of software delivery. It involves frequent code integration, automated testing, and continuous deployment of software changes to production.

To see this in action, navigate to the feature branch of this repository. Then, go to the Actions tab and click on the "app.py changes" to observe the testing that CI/CD performs.
